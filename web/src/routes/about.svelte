	<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Experience the magic of curated real estate listings</h1>
<br>
<h3 class="text-xl">Why does this exist?</h3>
<br>
<p>We weren't satisfied with the existing listing websites! Redfin, Zillow, Trulia, etc. have filters for everything from HOA fees to whether a place has a pool, but they all ignore an important question:
<br><br>
<em>“Is this place boring?”</em>
<br><br>
Boring is subjective, but you know it when you see it. It’s the one thing machines can’t do for us...yet.
<br><br>
So while it remains a job for humans, let us be those humans. Let us be your professional home critics, home connoisseurs, or even homeliers ™️.
<br><br>
By digging through every listing and pulling out only the hits, we'll save you time and because we are neither buyer nor seller, you’re getting a genuine independent recommendation.
<br><br>
</p>
<h3 class="text-xl">So is this just going to be fancy stuff?</h3>
<br>
<p>Hell no, friend! Cool doesn’t have to mean expensive. Of course money can sometimes help, but it’s only part of the equation.
<br><br>
</p>
<h3 class="text-xl">How often is the site updated?</h3>
<br>
<p>Every day! And that includes new listings, price changes ,and sale status.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="text-xl">Who runs this and is he currently unemployed in large part as a result of America’s disgraceful response to COVID-19?</h3>
<br>
<p>You’re talking about <a class="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwernecke/">John Wernecke</a> and yes, yes he is...</p>
