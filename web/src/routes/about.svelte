<br>
<p>Redfin and Zillow have filters for everything from HOA fees to whether a place has a pool, but they‘re ignoring an important question:
<br><br>
“Is this boring?”
<br><br>
Boring is subjective, but you know it when you see it. It’s the one thing machines can’t do for us...yet.
<br><br>
So while it remains a job for humans, I want to be that human. A professional home critic, a home connoisseur, a homelier ™️	
<br><br>
By digging through every listing and pulling out only the hits, I’ll save you time and because I’m neither buyer nor seller, you’re getting a genuine independent recommendation.
<br><br>
So is this just going to be fancy stuff?
<br><br>
Hell no, friend! Cool doesn’t have to mean expensive. Of course money can sometimes help, but it’s only part of the equation.
<br><br>
How often is the site updated?
<br><br>
Every day, if I find something worthwhile.
<br><br>
Why are all of these in Chicago?
<br><br>
It’s where I live and what I know, but adding other locations is a possibility down the road!
<br><br>
Who runs this and is he currently unemployed in large part as a result of America’s disgraceful response to COVID-19?
<br><br>
You’re talking about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwernecke/">John Wernecke</a> and yes, yes I am...
<br><br>
Got something to say?
